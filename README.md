Spider is a "choose your own adventure"-styled game that I wrote as a way to apply what I have learned to do in Ruby so far.

# Gameplay
Run the `spider.rb` file using Ruby in your command line terminal. Alternately, you can visit [this Replit](https://replit.com/@mark-ertmer/spidergame#main.rb) to run the program in your web browser.

To play the game, simply read the text that appears and enter your choices when prompted with questions about where to go and what to do.

# Helpful Hints
* Some outcomes are better than others. Try playing through the game several times, making different choices along the way. Even the name you enter can affect your game!
* The most positive outcomes occur when you are able to face the spider with an item that aligns with your chosen objective of catch, kill, or avoid.

# How's my Coding?
I have annotated the `spider.rb` file to explain each part of the code I wrote. Most of it I figured out through trial and error. I would not be surprised if there are easier ways to accomplish certain things in the program. If so, I would love to hear your suggestions!

Or if you run into any bugs or errors. Any and all feedback is appreciated!

Also feel free to fork this to change it around and maybe make your own game from it. Have fun!

Thanks for checking this out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
